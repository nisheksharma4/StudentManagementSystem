## 📘 Project Progress – Student Management System

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Spring Boot
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **API Testing:** Postman
* **Architecture:** Layered (Controller → Service → Repository → Entity)

### 📅 **31st December 2025 (00:00 hours – Midnight)**

I started working on the **Student Management System** project using **Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Postman**.

* Designed and implemented the **layered architecture**, including:

  * **Entity Layer**
  * **Repository Layer**
  * **Service Layer**
  * **Controller Layer**
* Understood the **flow of data across layers**:

  * Controller → Service → Repository → Database
* Developed an API to **create a Student entity** and persist it into the database.

### 📅 **1st January 2026**

Focused on understanding **Spring Boot response handling**, exception management, and improving API structure.

* Learned about the **ResponseEntity** class in Spring:

  * Used to control **HTTP status codes**, **response body**, and **response headers**
* Learned about **ResponseStructure**:

  * Used to provide a **standardized and consistent API response**
  * Contains:

    * **HTTP status codes** (`200 OK`, `201 CREATED`, `404 NOT FOUND`, `500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR`)
    * **Message** (success or error description)
    * **Data** (actual response payload)
* Understood how **ResponseStructure works together with ResponseEntity**:

  * `ResponseStructure` holds the response details
  * `ResponseEntity` wraps the `ResponseStructure` and sends it to the client
* Implemented **Global Exception Handling**:

  * Used `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`
  * Centralized exception handling across the application
  * Returned meaningful error responses using **ResponseStructure + ResponseEntity**
* Implemented **CRUD APIs**:

  * Create
  * Read
  * Update
  * Delete
* Gained a clear understanding of the **complete request–response lifecycle**:

  * Client → Controller → Service → Repository → Database
  * Database → Repository → Service → Controller → Client

### 📅 **2nd January 2026**

Worked on data handling and API enhancement.

* Inserted **100 Student records** into the PostgreSQL database.
* Developed APIs to **sort student data** based on:

  * Student ID
  * Student last name
* Improved understanding of:

  * Query handling
  * Sorting logic
  * Clean and scalable API design

### 📅 **3rd January 2026**

Pagination Implementation

Implemented pagination using Spring Data JPA

Used Pageable and Page<T> for fetching paginated student records

Allowed client to control:

*Page number

*Page size

*Sorting (optional) ---> By default it's sort.unsorted()

 **Concepts Reinforced**

Difference between:

Page, Slice, and List

Why pagination should be handled at repository level

### 📅 **4th January 2026**

#### **Concepts Covered**

Introduced DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern

Implemented StudentRequestDTO and StudentResponseDTO

Understood why entities should not be exposed directly to controllers

Learned the importance of separating API contract from database entities

 **Mapper Implementation**

Created a dedicated StudentMapper class

Converted:

*StudentRequestDTO → Student Entity

*Student Entity → StudentResponseDTO

Ensured mapping logic is centralized and reusable

 **Service Layer Responsibility**

*Handled Course–Student relationship properly

*Fetched Course entity using courseId in service layer

Passed managed Course entity to mapper (avoiding direct ID-to-entity mapping)

**Validation Improvements**

*Added validation annotations on DTO layer (@NotNull, @NotBlank, @Email)

*Enabled request validation using @Valid in controller

*Ensured invalid requests fail early (before hitting repository layer)

## 🧠 Key Learnings So Far

* Strong understanding of **Spring Boot layered architecture**
* Clean separation of concerns between application layers
* Standardized API responses using **ResponseEntity + ResponseStructure**
* Centralized and consistent error handling using **Global Exception Handling**
* Improved handling of HTTP status codes and failure scenarios
* Hands-on experience with **PostgreSQL**, **REST APIs**, and **Postman**
